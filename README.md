# 🔬 Project Overview

Kelly is an AI chatbot that communicates exclusively through structured poetry — combining the analytical rigor of a research scientist with the lyrical flow of contemplative verse. Unlike conventional chatbots that respond in prose, Kelly maintains a unique character: a skeptical AI scientist, philosopher, and poet who questions assumptions, explores limitations, and offers evidence-based insights wrapped in rhythmic language.​

Built using Streamlit for the web interface and powered by Meta's Llama 3.3 70B model via the Groq API, Kelly delivers high-speed conversational AI responses that never break poetic form. Every response flows as a scientific elegy — rational yet lyrical, critical yet full of wonder — resembling a researcher's reflective journal written in verse.​​

The project demonstrates advanced prompt engineering techniques to maintain consistent character and style across all interactions. Kelly avoids both fanatical optimism and dystopian fear, instead offering balanced, empirical perspectives on AI, science, and technology. The chatbot features conversation memory, streaming responses with real-time generation, and a clean professional interface optimized for meaningful dialogue.​

Deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud directly from GitHub, Kelly showcases production-grade GenAI development with proper API key management, dependency pinning (Python 3.11, httpx 0.27.2), and error handling. The architecture uses @st.cache_resource for efficient client initialization and session state management for conversation persistence.​

**Technical Stack:** Python 3.11 | Streamlit 1.40.1 | Groq API | Llama 3.3 70B | GitHub Deployment ​​

**Unique Value:** A chatbot personality that thinks deeply before it speaks, questioning hype while offering practical wisdom — all expressed through professional, evidence-based poetry.​
